\title{This function provides the p-value of an adaptation of the Portmanteau statistic to test if there is some dependence in the rows of the residuals matrix given as an argument of the function.}
\usage{
whitening_test(residuals)
}
\arguments{
\item{residuals}{the residuals matrix obtained by fitting a linear model to each column of the response matrix as if they were independent}
}
\value{
the p-value of a whitening test. If the p-value is small (generally smaller than 0.05)
it means that the hypothesis that each row of the  residuals matrix is a white noise, is rejected.
}
\description{
