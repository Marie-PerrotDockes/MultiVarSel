#' This function provides the p-value of an adaptation of the Portmanteau statistic to test if there is some dependence in the rows of the residuals matrix given as an argument of the function.
#'
#' @param  residuals the residuals matrix obtained by fitting a linear model to each column of the response matrix as if they were independent
#' @return the p-value of a whitening test. If the p-value is small (generally smaller than 0.05)
#' it means that the hypothesis that each row of the  residuals matrix is a white noise, is rejected.
